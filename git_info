First intall git if you don't have it.  If you have windows you'll also need a terminal program.  I use cmder
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Using the terminal navigate to where you want to keep your project folder.  Then run this command to get the files on your computer.
git clone https://github.com/SRutherf/CS181-P1.git

Git works by having a default branch called master and branches off of it.  The master branch acts as a final location for code changes
whereas the branches act as a testing ground before they are submitted to master.

I created 3 branches with our names.  To access yours run the command
git checkout yourfirstname

From there you can make any changes to your files.

To check the files you've changed use the following command.  It shows you what branch you're in and other useful info.
git status

Once you've made changes run the following commands to put it on github.  In order they add files you wish to upload, add a helpful message that explains the change, and then pushes it to github
git add filename (or run "git add ." to add all)
git commit -m "Sample summary text"
git push origin yourfirstname

Note that git push origin alone pushes the files to master.

Once the files are pushed to your branch go to the repo page on github.com.  You'll see a 'compare and pull request' button.
Press this and make sure that the base field is master and the compare field is your branch.  
This window let's you add comments, tag people, and make sure that you're submitting the correct changes.

Once you're satisfied click on create pull request.  This creates a submission that other teammates can review.  If we agree the changes are good then anyone can merge the request and the code will be on master.
In big projects it's considered bad for people who create the pull request to merge it, but since this is a small team and changes might be minor don't worry about that.
